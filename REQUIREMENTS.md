### 4. Mental Calculation Strategies & Problem Categories

#### Addition Strategies

- **Bridging to 10s**: `88 + 99` → `89 + 100 - 2` → `187`
- **Doubles**: `47 + 48` → `47 + 47 + 1` → `95`
- **Breaking Apart**: `67 + 28` → `67 + 30 - 2` → `95`
- **Left-to-Right**: `45 + 37` → `40 + 30 + 5 + 7` → `82`

#### Subtraction Strategies

- **Bridging Down**: `83 - 47` → `83 - 50 + 3` → `36`
- **Adding Up**: `62 - 38` → "What + 38 = 62?" → `24`
- **Compensation**: `74 - 29` → `74 - 30 + 1` → `45`

#### Multiplication Strategies

- **Doubling**: `15 × 4` → `15 × 2 × 2` → `60`
- **Breaking Apart**: `23 × 7` → `(20 × 7) + (3 × 7)` → `161`
- **Near Squares**: `19 × 21` → `20² - 1²` → `399`
- **Times 5**: `46 × 5` → `46 ÷ 2 × 10` → `230`
- **Times 9**: `37 × 9` → `37 × 10 - 37` → `333`

#### Division Strategies

- **Factor Recognition**: `144 ÷ 12` → `144 ÷ 4 ÷ 3` → `30`
- **Multiplication Inverse**: `91 ÷ 7` → "What × 7 = 91?" → `13`
- **Estimation & Adjustment**: `156 ÷ 13` → Try `12`, adjust → `12`

### 5. Training Sessions

- **Default Length**: 10 questions per session
- **Start Mechanism**: Dedicated "Start" button
- **Problem Selection**: Random from enabled operation types
- **Timing**: Track time per problem and total session time
- **Immediate Feedback**: Show correct/incorrect after each answer
- **Session Summary**:
  - Total correct/incorrect count
  - Time breakdown per problem
  - Overall session time
  - Performance insights

### 6. Educational Feedback System

- **Wrong Answer Teaching**: When user answers incorrectly, show:
  - The correct answer
  - Step-by-step mental strategy for that problem type
  - Alternative approaches if applicable
  - Practice suggestion for similar problems
