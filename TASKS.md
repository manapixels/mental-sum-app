## Phase 8: Advanced Progress & Adaptive Learning

### Data Model & Persistence

- [ ] Define and implement `strategyPerformance` object in user profile schema (e.g., `{ strategyId: { correct, incorrect, totalAttempts, avgTime } }`).
- [ ] Define and implement schema for storing individual problem attempt history (e.g., `{ problemDetails, userAnswer, correctAnswer, isCorrect, strategyUsed, timestamp }`).
- [ ] Update `localStorage` CRUD operations (saveUser, loadUser, etc.) to support new data structures for strategy performance and problem history.
- [ ] Implement data migration logic for existing users to initialize new data fields (if necessary).

### Problem Generation Engine

- [ ] Design and implement adaptive problem selection algorithm (e.g., using weakness scores based on `strategyPerformance`).
- [ ] Modify problem generator to accept an optional `focusedStrategyId` parameter to generate problems for a specific strategy.
- [ ] Ensure all generated problems are tagged with an `intendedStrategy` (or an array of applicable strategies).
- [ ] Integrate user's `strategyPerformance` data into the adaptive problem selection logic.

### State Management (Contexts)

- [ ] Update `UserContext` to store, manage, and provide `strategyPerformance` and problem attempt history.
- [ ] Add functions to `UserContext` to:

  - [ ] Log a completed problem attempt to history.
  - [ ] Update `strategyPerformance` metrics after each problem.

- [ ] Update `SessionContext` to manage an optional `focusedStrategyId` for targeted practice sessions.

### User Interface: Progress Display

- [ ] Create `StrategyProgressCard` component to display metrics for a single mental model strategy.
- [ ] Create `UserStrategyProgressList` component to display a list of `StrategyProgressCard`s for all applicable strategies.

- [ ] Implement "Practice this Skill" buttons within `StrategyProgressCard` or `UserStrategyProgressList`.
- [ ] Integrate `UserStrategyProgressList` into a user-facing page (e.g., a new "My Progress" page, or an enhanced User Profile/Session Results page).

### User Interface: Incorrect Answer Review

- [ ] Design UI for displaying a list of past problems, with filters (e.g., show only incorrect, by date, by operation).

- [ ] Create `ProblemReviewCard` component to display details of a single past problem (original problem, user's answer, correct answer, strategy explanation).
- [ ] Implement a page or modal view for `ProblemReviewCard` list and individual review.
- [ ] Link to this review system from session results or user progress areas.

### Session Flow Integration

- [ ] Update session logic to log all attempted problems (with relevant details like `intendedStrategy`) to `UserContext`.
- [ ] Ensure session start logic correctly initializes in adaptive mode (default) or focused strategy mode based on `SessionContext` (`focusedStrategyId`).

### Overall Integration & Testing

- [ ] Thoroughly test the adaptive problem generation logic across various user performance scenarios.
- [ ] Test the focused strategy practice flow from selection to session completion.
- [ ] Validate the accuracy of progress tracking for both overall strategy performance and individual problem history.
- [ ] Perform usability testing on the new progress display and answer review UIs.
